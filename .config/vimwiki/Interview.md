# Tell me something about yourself {{{
  I am a geek for tech. I love programming
  I have mostly worked on Typescript, JavaScript, React, Node which you'll notice is all just javascript
  My professional experience has mostly been centered around javascript but I like to consider myself technology agnostic

  Other than that I have also worked on a bunch of personal projects involving golang, bash, haskell, etc
  Fan of functional programming. Basically an FP nerd. I love it

  Also, I try to set higher standards for myself and the projects that I work on

  ? I am very opinionated about a lot of technologies but at the end of the day, efficiency can only be measured when you have the output

# My experience {{{
  I have been working with people interactive for about 2 years
  Before that I was working at a ed-tech company called yocket for a year. It was a start up

  At people interactive I am a play a lead role for a team of 4
  We worked on an SSR project using nextJS
}}}


# Reason for leaving {{{
  I want to expand my skillset
  Working at shaadi.com, I felt like I was reaching a saturation point for what I can give to the company and also what I can get back
  I feel domesticated to the way of doing things there
}}}


# What do you want {{{
  Looking for a full-stack role but I can work on the front-end as well
  Work on exciting new technologies
  Freedom to have the right discussions about the choices we make in tech
  Manage a team
  Work at scale
