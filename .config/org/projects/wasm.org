** Wasm transform import statement/expression
   - [ ] Parse syntax tree and transform wasm imports
   - [ ] For github link `@user/repo:examples/rust.wasm`, download the wasm
     file and store it in node_modules (or wasm_modules)
   - [ ] Github links(`@user/repo`) defaults to `index.wasm` file
   - [ ] Add option to inline wasm buffer
   - [ ] Import statement will get transformed to root-level await?
   - [ ] Only dynamic imports allowed for wasm imports?
   - [ ] Tooling to support wasm imports (editor plugins, etc)
   - [ ] The repo needs to have a `.wasm` file and a `.d.ts` file for compile
     time type safety
